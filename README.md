### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

thank you much for visiting my GitHub profile. 

I hope this page will provide you with an overview about my portfolio projects realized from 2020 up to now:

### Data Science & AI ###

#### Image Classification ###

**ðŸŒ± Flower Classifier**: This is a neural network for image classification created with Python and PyTorch as a framework. The project has been realized in my Udacity Nanodegree certification course "AI Programming with Python" and was the second of two projects I realized. 

- Input data are *images*
- Output data is *flower name*
- Algorithm used is *MLP* in PyTorch
- enhanced by transfer learning

**ðŸŒ± Dog Breed Classifier**: This is a neural network for image classification created with Python and PyTorch as a framework. The project has been realized in my Udacity Nanodegree certification course "Deep Learning" and was the second of two projects I implemented. Here, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used.

- Input data are *images*
- Output data is *dog breed name*
- Algorithm used is *CNN* in PyTorch

#### Predicting Time Series Data ###

**ðŸŒ± Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns**: This is a neural network where historical tabular data is used to predict bike sharing patterns in New York City based on various features like e.g. temperature, wind speed, historical bike usage pattern etc. This neural network has been created with Python and *NumPy* only, without a framework like *PyTorch*. The project has been realized in my Udacity Nanodegree certification course "Deep Learning" and was the first of five projects I submitted. The goal of this project was to learn how to deal with matrix multiplication in Neural Networks. The sizes have to match with each other in the calculation sequence so that forward pass and backpropagation work. 

- Input data is *tabular time series data*
- Output data is *tabular time series data*
- No ready-to-use algorithm, hands on implementation in Numpy

#### Seq2Seq Networks for Text Generation ####

**ðŸŒ± Generate TV Scripts**: This is a RNN/LSTM network architecture where text data is used to generate a script dialogue for the US sitcom "Seinfeld". This neural network has been created with Python and *PyTorch*. The project has been implemented/developed within in my Udacity Nanodegree certification course "Deep Learning" and was the third of five projects I realized. The goal of this project was to learn how networks can be trained with specific texts to generate new texts being given some words as a starting point. 

- Input data is *text data* (existing TV scripts for US sitcom "Seinfeld"
- Output data is *script text*
- Algorithm used is a combination of ***RNN*** and ***LSTM*** in ***PyTorch***

#### Great Adversarial Networks (GANs) ####

**ðŸŒ± Generate Fictitious Faces with CycleGANs**: This is a GAN network architecture where existing of images from celebrities are used to generate new, realistic, but non existing celebrity images. This neural network has been created with Python and *PyTorch*. The project has been realized in my Udacity Nanodegree certification course "Deep Learning" and was the fourth of five projects I implemented. The goal of this project was to learn how GAN networks can be used to generate completely new images given a set of images of the same type. 

- Input data is *image data* (Celebrities)
- Output data is *image data*
- Algorithm used is ***GAN*** in ***PyTorch***

#### Model Deployment in the AWS Cloud ####

**ðŸŒ± Sentiment Analysis**: This is a network architecture where text data (reviews) is used to output the feeling of the author of the review based on the words he/she has chosen in his/her writing. This neural network has been created with Python and *PyTorch* and was deployed using AWS Sagemaker. The project has been realized in my Udacity Nanodegree certification course "Deep Learning" and was the fifth of five projects I worked on. The goal of this project was to learn how to deploy models in the AWS Cloud. 

- Input data is *text data* (reviews)
- Output data is a ranking (feeling/mood of the author)
- Model was deployed in AWS Cloud
